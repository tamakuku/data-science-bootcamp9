Thanks for the practice.

## Objective:
- To simulate a data analyst management system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## Features:
01 Data Analyst Attribute Display: Displays the attributes of the data analyst, such as name, age, skill, and salary.

02 Learning Status: Displays a message indicating the data analyst is upskilling.

03 Job Search: Displays a message indicating the data analyst is looking for a new job.

04 Salary Increment: Increases the salary of the data analyst by a specified amount.

05 Salary Update: Displays the updated salary after the data analyst gets a new job.

## Components:
- DA Class: Defines the Data Analyst (DA) class with attributes such as name, age, skill, and salary.

### Methods:
- show_attributes: Displays the attributes of the data analyst.
- learning: Displays a message indicating the data analyst is learning and upskilling.
- new_jobs: Displays a message indicating the data analyst is looking for a new job.
- plus_salary: Increases the salary of the data analyst and displays the increment.
- update_salary: Displays the updated salary after the data analyst gets a new job.

## Project Outcome:
- The OOP Data Analyst simulator provides a structured way to manage data analyst attributes and activities.
It allows for easy tracking and display of an analyst's learning status, job search activities, and salary updates.
