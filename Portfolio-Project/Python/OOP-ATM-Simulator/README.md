Thanks for the practice.

## Objective:
- To simulate an ATM system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

### Features:
01 Account Information Display: Displays the account name, bank name, and balance.

02 Balance Inquiry: Checks and displays the current balance.

03 Deposit Functionality: Allows users to deposit money into their account.

04 Withdrawal Functionality: Allows users to withdraw money from their account.

05 OTP Generation: Generates a One-Time Password (OTP) for security verification.

06 Account Name Change: Allows users to change their account name with OTP verification.

### Components:
- ATM Class: Defines the ATM class with attributes such as account name, bank name, and balance.
- Methods:
  - __str__: Displays the account information.
  - check_balance: Checks and displays the current balance.
  - deposit: Adds money to the account balance.
  - withdraw: Deducts money from the account balance.
  - get_OTP: Generates a random OTP for security verification.
  - change_account_name: Allows users to change their account name with OTP verification.
 
### Project Outcome:
- The OOP ATM simulator provides a convenient interface for users to perform banking transactions such as balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.
- It also ensures security by implementing OTP verification for sensitive operations like account name changes.
