# Overview
- This project creates a simple HTML webpage that displays text, an image, and a button with an event handler using JavaScript. The HTML page is styled using CSS embedded within the HTML file. This README explains the code structure and functionality, providing a comprehensive understanding of the implementation.

# Project Structure
## The project consists of two main files:
1. index.html - The HTML file that structures the content and includes CSS for styling.
2. index.js - The JavaScript file that adds dynamic behavior to the webpage.

## HTML Structure
- DOCTYPE Declaration: Defines the document type and version of HTML.
- Head Section: Contains meta information and internal CSS styles.
- Body Section: Contains the main content and references the JavaScript file.
