Thanks for the practice.

## Objective
- The objective of this project is to analyze flight data from the nycflights13 dataset using R. By leveraging various R packages and functions, we aim to answer specific questions about flight performance, delays, distances, and other characteristics for flights in 2013.

## Data Sources
- The dataset used for this project is flights from the nycflights13 package, which includes comprehensive details about all flights that departed from NYC in 2013.

## Data Analysis Tasks
- Identify the five best-performing flights in terms of the shortest arrival delays.
- Calculate the average flight delays for January.
- Determine which month had the longest total flight distances.
- Count the number of flights departing between 6:00 AM and 6:00 PM in March.
- Count the number of flights with tail numbers starting with "N8" operated by United Air Lines Inc. (carrier code "UA").

## Methodology
### The analysis was performed using the following R packages:
- readr for reading and writing CSV files.
- sqldf for executing SQL queries on R data frames.
- nycflights13 for accessing the flight dataset.
- dplyr for data manipulation using a syntax with the %>% pipeline operator.

## Analysis Questions
1. Best Five Performing Flights (Shortest Delay)
2. Average Flights Delay in January
3. Month with Longest Distance Flights
4. Flights Departing at Noon in March
5. Flights with Tail Number Starting with "N8" from UA
