Thanks for the practice.

## Overview
- This project showcases an implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game using R programming. The code is designed to interact with users, taking their input, and simulating a game against a computer opponent. The game keeps track of the scores and provides a summary at the end of the session. This project demonstrates proficiency in basic R programming, user input handling, and conditional logic.

## Key Features
1. User Interaction:
- The game begins with a welcome message and instructions.
- The user is prompted to enter their name, which personalizes the game experience.

2. Gameplay Mechanics:
- The game continues in a loop, allowing users to play multiple rounds.
- Users can choose between "hammer", "scissors", or "paper" for their turn.
- The computer randomly selects its move.

3. Scoring System:
- Each win earns the user or the computer one point.
- The game continues until the user types "stop", at which point the scores are summarized and displayed.

4. Game Rules:
- Detailed rules are provided at the start of the game to ensure clarity.

5. End of Game Summary:
- The game announces the final scores and the overall winner.

## Project Outcome:
- This Rock-Paper-Scissors game implementation provides an interactive and engaging way to demonstrate fundamental R programming skills. The project is an excellent example of how to handle user inputs, apply conditional logic, and manage a simple game loop in R. This addition to your portfolio will showcase your ability to create user-centric applications and provide a solid foundation for more complex projects.
