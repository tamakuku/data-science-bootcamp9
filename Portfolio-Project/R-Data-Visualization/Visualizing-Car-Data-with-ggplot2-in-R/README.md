This project come from practice made by Data Rockie School.

Thanks for the practice.

## Objective
- The objective of this project is to create and analyze visualizations using the mpg dataset from the ggplot2 package in R. We aim to extract insights about car models, engine displacement, fuel efficiency, and manufacturer comparisons through various plots.

## Data Sources
- The dataset used for this project is mpg from the ggplot2 package, which contains information about fuel economy for various car models.

## Data Visualization Tasks
1. Bar Plot: Identify the most popular car model produced by Ford.
2. Histogram Plot: Segment the distribution of engine displacement (displ) in cars.
3. Scatter Plot: Examine the relationship between engine displacement (displ) and city miles per gallon (cty).
4. Scatter Plot Comparison: Compare highway miles per gallon (hwy) for cars with automatic transmission between Ford and Audi.
5. Facet Scatter Plot: Investigate the relationship between the number of cylinders (cyl) and city miles per gallon (cty) across different car classes.

## Methodology
### The visualizations were created using the following R packages:
- ggplot2 for creating the plots.
- patchwork for arranging multiple plots in a single view.
- tidyverse for data manipulation and transformation.
- readr for reading and writing CSV files.

## Analysis Chart
1. Bar Plot: Ford's Car Models
2. Histogram Plot: Engine Displacement
3. Scatter Plot: Displacement vs. City MPG
4. Scatter Plot Comparison: Ford vs. Audi with Automatic Transmission
5. Facet Scatter Plot: Cylinders vs. City MPG in Ford's Car Classes
